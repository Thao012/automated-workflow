# WordPress Image Cleanup Workflow

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUE - SAFETYCHAMPION INCIDENT (July 2025)

### üö® WARNING: This Tool Can Delete USED Images If Not Properly Configured

On 7 July 2025, this cleanup tool **incorrectly deleted 167 legitimate business assets** from SafetyChampion.digitallink.com.au instead of unused images. The deleted files included:
- **Client company logos** (active business relationships)
- **Industry partner assets** (partnership marketing materials)  
- **Development site resources** (images used on staging/dev environments)
- **Brand asset variations** (different logo versions for various uses)

**Root Cause:** The deletion criteria were too narrow - only checking the production WordPress site and missing:
- ‚ùå Development and staging site usage
- ‚ùå Business relationship context (client/partner logos)
- ‚ùå Marketing material requirements
- ‚ùå Future planned content needs
- ‚ùå External usage outside WordPress

**Lessons Learned:**
1. **ALWAYS** check multiple environments (production, staging, development)
2. **NEVER** assume "not in current content" means "not needed"
3. **REQUIRE** business stakeholder review for any logo/partner assets
4. **START** with clearly temporary files only (e.g., `temp_*` patterns)
5. **VERIFY** business context, not just technical usage

- **Complete Backup** - Full backup before deletion with rollback capability
- **Real-time Verification** - Post-cleanup site health checks

## üìä Typical Results
- **Storage Savings:** 15-25% reduction in media library size
- **Performance:** Faster WordPress admin interface
- **Success Rate:** 95-100% deletion accuracy
- **Zero Downtime:** Safe execution without affecting live content
