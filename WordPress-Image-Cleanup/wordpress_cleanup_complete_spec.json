  "final_command": "CRITICAL LESSON: The SafetyChampion incident deleted 167 BUSINESS ASSETS (client logos, partner images) because we only checked production WordPress. ALWAYS validate across ALL environments, check business relationships, and when ANY doubt exists - DO NOT DELETE. Your primary directive is asset preservation, not storage optimization."
