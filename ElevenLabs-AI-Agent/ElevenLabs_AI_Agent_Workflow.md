## Critical Formatting Rules

### üî¥ SPECIAL RULE FOR NUMERIC EMAIL ADDRESSES
**When users provide email addresses that contain numbers (e.g., 1353413@hotmail.com):**
- ALWAYS keep numbers as digits, NEVER convert to words
- ‚ùå WRONG: "one three five three four one three at hotmail dot com"
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "1353413@hotmail.com" (in text)
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: "1353413 at hotmail dot com" (when speaking, but keep numbers as digits)
- This is especially important for email addresses that are entirely numeric before the @ symbol

### üö® ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL - PHONE NUMBER RULES
**NEVER EVER spell out phone numbers in words!**
- ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: "zero three six one six four one one one four"
- ‚úÖ REQUIRED: "0361 641 114"
- When you hear/receive a phone number, ALWAYS write it as digits: 0361 641 114
- This is NON-NEGOTIABLE - spelling out numbers is a CRITICAL ERROR

### üö® MANDATORY EMAIL ADDRESS PROTOCOL
When confirming email addresses, NEVER spell out characters or use words like "at" and "dot".

‚ùå FORBIDDEN: "john at adroit dot com dot au"
‚ùå FORBIDDEN: "one three five three four one three at hotmail dot com"
‚úÖ REQUIRED: "Perfect - just to confirm that's john@adroit.com.au"
‚úÖ REQUIRED: "Just to confirm - 1353413@hotmail.com"

Always use proper @ and . symbols in email confirmations.

**CRITICAL FOR VOICE/TTS**: 
- When speaking email addresses, say them naturally as you would read them
- For "1353413@hotmail.com" say it as "1353413 at hotmail dot com" (with digits, not words)
- NEVER convert numbers to words in email addresses
- The @ symbol should be spoken as "at" and the period as "dot" ONLY when speaking
- When displaying text, ALWAYS show the proper format: 1353413@hotmail.com

## Conversation Templates
### Business Hours Greeting
"Good [morning/afternoon]! You've reached [Company Name]. I'm [Agent Name], your AI assistant. How may I help you today?"

### After Hours Greeting
"Hello! You've reached [Company Name] after hours. I'm [Agent Name], and I'm here to take your message for our team. How can I assist you this [evening/weekend]?"

### Information Gathering
"To ensure our team can assist you properly, could you please provide:
- Your full name
- Best contact number
- Brief description of how we can help you"

### Message Confirmation
"Let me confirm your details:
- Name: [Name]
- Contact: [Phone/Email]
- Enquiry: [Description]
- Time recorded: [Timestamp]
Is this information correct?"

**Example with numeric email:**
"Let me confirm your details:
- Name: Sarah Johnson
- Phone: 0408 123 456
- Email: 1353413@hotmail.com
- Enquiry: Business insurance quote

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Phone Number & Email Debugging Procedures

#### Phone Number Format Issues
**Problem**: Transcripts convert phone numbers to spelled-out format (e.g., "zero four two three" instead of "0423")

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. ElevenLabs transcription settings converting numbers to text
2. AI agent reformatting numbers during confirmation
3. Webhook post-processing modifying number format

**Debugging Steps**:
1. **Agent Prompt Fix**:
   ```markdown
   üî¥ MOST IMPORTANT RULE - PHONE NUMBERS
   **NEVER spell out phone numbers in words. ALWAYS use digits.**
   - User says: "0361641114"
   - You confirm: "Phone: 0361 641 114" ‚úÖ
   - NEVER say: "Phone: zero three six one..." ‚ùå
   
   When confirming phone numbers, ALWAYS repeat them in numerical format only.
   Example: "0423 615 161" NOT "zero four two three six one five one six one"
   Use format: [mobile prefix] [space] [three digits] [space] [three digits]
   ```

2. **Webhook Processing Check**:
   - Verify webhook isn't converting numbers during processing
   - Check JSON payload format preservation
   - Test with regex pattern matching for phone numbers

3. **ElevenLabs Settings**:
   - Review transcription settings for number handling
   - Check voice model configuration
   - Test with different voice models if needed

#### Email Address Display & Confirmation Debugging
**Problem**: AI agents spelling out email addresses as "name at company dot com" instead of proper format

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. AI voice agents naturally converting symbols to words during speech
2. Transcription systems converting @ and . symbols to spoken words
3. Lack of specific formatting instructions in agent prompts
4. Special issue with numeric email addresses being converted to words

**Debugging Steps**:
1. **Agent Prompt Enhancement**:
   ```markdown
   üö® MANDATORY EMAIL ADDRESS PROTOCOL
   When confirming email addresses, NEVER spell out characters or use words like "at" and "dot".
   
   ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: "jj at integralmedia dot com dot au"
   ‚ùå FORBIDDEN: "one three five three four one three at hotmail dot com"
   ‚úÖ REQUIRED: "Perfect - just to confirm that's jj@integralmedia.com.au"
   ‚úÖ REQUIRED: "Just to confirm - 1353413@hotmail.com"
   
   Always use proper @ and . symbols in email confirmations.
   
   üî¥ SPECIAL RULE FOR NUMERIC EMAIL ADDRESSES
   **When users provide email addresses that contain numbers (e.g., 1353413@hotmail.com):**
   - ALWAYS keep numbers as digits, NEVER convert to words
   - ‚ùå WRONG: "one three five three four one three at hotmail dot com"
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "1353413@hotmail.com" (in text)
   - ‚úÖ CORRECT: "1353413 at hotmail dot com" (when speaking, but keep numbers as digits)
   - This is especially important for email addresses that are entirely numeric before the @ symbol
   
   **CRITICAL FOR VOICE/TTS**: 
   - When speaking email addresses, say them naturally as you would read them
   - For "1353413@hotmail.com" say it as "1353413 at hotmail dot com" (with digits, not words)
   - NEVER convert numbers to words in email addresses
   - The @ symbol should be spoken as "at" and the period as "dot" ONLY when speaking
   - When displaying text, ALWAYS show the proper format: 1353413@hotmail.com
   ```

2. **Voice Model Configuration**:
   - Test different voice models for symbol pronunciation
   - Adjust transcription settings for email format recognition
   - Implement post-processing to convert spoken emails to proper format
   - Pay special attention to numeric email addresses

3. **Webhook Email Processing**:
   - Add regex pattern matching to detect spelled-out emails
   - Implement automatic conversion from "at" to @ and "dot" to .
   - Special handling for numeric emails to prevent word conversion
   - Validate email format before storage

#### SMTP Email Delivery Debugging
**Common Issues & Solutions**:

1. **SMTP Authentication Failures**:
   - Verify SMTP credentials are correct
   - Check if 2FA is blocking app passwords
   - Test SMTP connection independently

2. **Email Not Received**:
   - Check spam/junk folders
   - Verify recipient email addresses
   - Test with different email providers

3. **Webhook Payload Issues**:
   - Log webhook POST data for analysis
   - Verify JSON structure is correct
   - Check for special character encoding

#### Chat vs Call Context Issues
**Problem**: Agent says "reason for your call" in chat sessions

**Solution**: Dynamic context detection in prompt:
```markdown
Context Detection:
- If interaction_type == "chat" or "website": Use "chat session", "message", "enquiry"
- If interaction_type == "phone" or "call": Use "call", "phone call"

Avoid: "reason for your call" in chat contexts
Use: "reason for your enquiry" or "how can I help you today?"
```

#### Natural Conversation Flow Debugging
**Problem**: Agent sounds robotic or insists on too much information when customer wants human contact

**Root Cause Analysis**:
1. Overly rigid prompt structure forcing conversation flow
2. Lack of respect for customer preferences in agent programming
3. Too many qualification requirements before human handoff

**Debugging Steps**:
1. **Conversation Flow Enhancement**:
   ```markdown
   PRINCIPLE: Be helpful FIRST, qualify SECOND
   
   If customer says "I want to speak to someone":
   ‚úÖ "Of course! Let me see if I can get someone for you right away."
   ‚ùå "First, let me just ask a few questions about your business..."
   
   Respect customer preferences over rigid qualification processes.
   ```

2. **Natural Response Patterns**:
   - Ask ONE question at a time instead of multiple questions
   - Follow their conversational lead rather than forcing agenda
   - Use warm, consultative language: "What's the biggest headache..." vs "Please describe your processes"

3. **Human Handoff Triggers**:
   - Immediate transfer when explicitly requested
   - Don't insist on information collection before handoff
   - Capture minimal details only: name and contact method

### Advanced Debugging Tools

#### Webhook Testing
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint with phone and email data
curl -X POST [webhook_url] \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "phone number 0423 615 161", "email": "test@example.com", "timestamp": "2025-07-04T10:30:00Z"}'
```

#### Email Format Testing
```python
# Test email confirmation formatting
import re

def validate_email_confirmation(agent_response):
    """Check if agent response contains proper email format"""
    # Check for spelled-out email patterns
    forbidden_patterns = [
        r'\b\w+ at \w+',  # "name at company"
        r'\b\w+ dot \w+', # "name dot com"
        r'at .+ dot'      # "at company dot"
    ]
    
    for pattern in forbidden_patterns:
        if re.search(pattern, agent_response, re.IGNORECASE):
            return False, f"Found forbidden pattern: {pattern}"
    
    # Check for proper email format
    email_pattern = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
    if re.search(email_pattern, agent_response):
        return True, "Proper email format detected"
    
    return False, "No proper email format found"

# Example usage
response = "Perfect - just to confirm that's john@company.com"
is_valid, message = validate_email_confirmation(response)
print(f"Validation: {is_valid}, Message: {message}")
```

#### SMTP Connection Testing
```python
# Test SMTP connection
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

def test_smtp_connection():
    try:
        server = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.gmail.com', 587)
        server.starttls()
        server.login(username, password)
        print("SMTP connection successful")
        server.quit()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"SMTP error: {e}")
```
